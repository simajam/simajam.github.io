- Developed a novel clause quality measure leveraging the structural properties of SAT formulas.
- Utilized tools and libraries like Gephi and Graphviz to visualize and analyze graphs from SAT formulas and created a tool to extract advanced features.
- Integrated innovative heuristics into advanced SAT solvers, enhancing performance
