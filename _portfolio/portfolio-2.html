<ul>
<li> Developed a novel clause quality measure leveraging the structural properties of SAT formulas.<\li>
<li> Utilized tools and libraries like Gephi and Graphviz to visualize and analyze graphs from SAT formulas and created a tool to extract advanced features.<\li>
<li> Integrated innovative heuristics into advanced SAT solvers, enhancing performance. <\li>
</ul>
