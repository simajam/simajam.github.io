We give a brief description of our solvers Maple_MBDR_Cent_PERM and Maple_MBDR_BJL.
Maple_MBDR_Cent_PERM stores high-centrality learned clauses permanently. Maple_MBDR_BJL, uses a simple and cheap scheme to learn additional small clauses. Both solvers are based on Relaxed_Maple_LCMDCBDL_newtech, the second place solver from the main track of the 2020 SAT Solver Competition.
