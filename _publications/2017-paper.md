We present a method we call structure-based preferential bumping, a low-cost way to exploit formula structure in VSIDS-based SAT solvers. We show that the SAT solver Glucose, when modified with preferential bumping of certain easily identified structurally important variables, out-performs unmodified Glucose on the industrial formulas from recent SAT solver competitions.
