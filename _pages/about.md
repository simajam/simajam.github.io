<p style="text-align: justify;">
I am a postdoctoral researcher at <a href="https://ucsd.edu/">UCSD</a>, working at the <a href="https://datascience.ucsd.edu/">Halıcıoğlu Data Science Institute</a>. I obtained my PhD in Computer Science under the supervision of <a href="https://www.sfu.ca/computing/people/faculty/davidmitchell.html">David Mitchell</a> at <a href="https://www.sfu.ca/">Simon Fraser University</a>. I also completed my master’s degree in Artificial Intelligence at the Computer Science Department of  <a href="https://en.sharif.ir/">Sharif University of Technology</a>.<br>

I have a broad interest in software development, particularly in areas such as algorithm design, optimization, and machine learning. My research focuses on developing scalable and efficient computational solutions to complex problems, with a strong emphasis on practical applications in artificial intelligence and data science. Throughout my academic journey, I have worked on a variety of projects ranging from SAT solver optimizations to location-based recommendation systems, constantly striving to bridge the gap between theoretical advancements and real-world implementations.
