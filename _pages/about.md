Hi there, I'm Sima!
======
I am a postdoctoral researcher at [UCSD](https://ucsd.edu/), working at the [Halıcıoğlu Data Science Institute](https://datascience.ucsd.edu/). I obtained my PhD in Computer Science under the supervision of [David Mitchell](https://www.cs.sfu.ca/~mitchell/) at [Simon Fraser University](https://www.sfu.ca/). I also completed my master’s degree in Artificial Intelligence at the Computer Science Department of [Sharif University of Technology](https://en.sharif.ir/).

I have a broad interest in software development, particularly in areas such as algorithm design, optimization, and machine learning. My research focuses on developing scalable and efficient computational solutions to complex problems, with a strong emphasis on practical applications in artificial intelligence and data science. Throughout my academic journey, I have worked on a variety of projects ranging from SAT solver optimizations to location-based recommendation systems, constantly striving to bridge the gap between theoretical advancements and real-world implementations.



I have been honored with the following awards and recognitions
------

- **Two-Year Postdoctoral Fellowship** for research in machine learning and data science (2022-2024)
